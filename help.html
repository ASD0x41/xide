        Welcome to <span style="color: #ffcc00; font-weight: bold;">XIDE</span> - an online <span style="color: #ffcc00; font-weight: bold;">x86 Assembly IDE</span> (Integrated Development Environment) set up by <span style="color: green; font-weight: bold;">ASD0x41</span>!<br/><br/>
    
        The purpose of this tool is to facilitate students who are studying assembly language. It eliminates the need for downloading and installing tools like assemblers, debuggers, and emulators separately. Instead, all you need to do is go to <a href="https://xide.nullprime.com/" style="color: #66ccff; text-decoration: underline;">https://xide.nullprime.com/</a> and your browser itself will become your IDE for assembly language programming.<br/><br/>
    
        More specifically, this tool is a combination of the <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #ff6666;">Netwide Assembler (NASM)</span>, the <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #ff6666;">Advanced Fullscreen Debugger (AFD)</span>, and the <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #ff6666;">DOSBox Emulator</span> (technically, a WASM port of DOSBox Emulator). If you are interested in further details about how exactly <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #ffcc00;">XIDE</span> has been implemented, visit the project's GitHub repo using the button on the top-right and read the documentation.<br/><br/>
    
        With regard to the usage of this tool, most of it is quite self-explanatory. You can open a <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">.asm</span> file using the <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #66ccff;">Open File</span> button (or by pressing <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #ff6666;">Ctrl + O</span>) and modify it or start from scratch inside the <span style="color: #66ccff;">Editor</span>. At any point, you can also download the contents of the <span style="color: #66ccff;">Editor</span> as a <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">.asm</span> file using the <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #66ccff;">Save File</span> button (or the <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #ff6666;">Ctrl + S</span> keys). Once you are done with coding, you can press the <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #66ccff;">Assemble</span> button (or <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #ff6666;">Alt + A</span>) to reload the <span style="color: #66ccff;">Emulator</span> and assemble your code (which will be present as <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; color: #ffcc00;">code.asm</span> inside the <span style="color: #66ccff;">Emulator</span>) using <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #ff6666;">NASM</span> to an executable file (which will be called <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; color: #ffcc00;">prog.asm</span>). You can also press <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #66ccff;">Execute</span> (or by pressing <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #ff6666;">Alt + X</span>) to both assemble as well as execute the assembled program inside the <span style="color: #66ccff;">DOSBox Emulator</span>. Alternatively, you can press <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #66ccff;">Debug</span> (or <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #ff6666;">Alt + D</span>) to assemble your code and then open the assembled program in the <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #ff6666;">Advanced Fullscreen Debugger (AFD)</span>.<br/><br/>
    
        If you just want to be able to access your code inside the <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #66ccff;">Emulator</span> and enter commands for assembly, debugging, execution etc. yourself, press the <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #66ccff;">Restart</span> button (or <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #ff6666;">Alt + R</span>). It will restart the <span style="color: #66ccff;">Emulator</span> after which your code will be available as <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;  color: #ffcc00;">code.asm</span> in its root directory. The <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #66ccff;">Restart</span> button can also be used to restart the <span style="color: #66ccff;">Emulator</span> for other purposes, such as to stop the execution of a program that keeps running indefinitely. This document can, of course, be accessed by pressing the <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #66ccff;">Help</span> button (or by pressing <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #ff6666;">Alt + H</span>).<br/><br/>

        Note that the code editor embedded in this IDE is the <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #ff6666;">Ajax.org Cloud9 Editor (ACE)</span>. This means that many of the keyboard shortcuts supported by <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #ff6666;">ACE</span> should work while the <span style="color: #66ccff;">Editor</span> is in focus (though some might not due to certain interactions with other components of the IDE). A list of those shortcuts can be seen at <a href="https://ace.c9.io/demo/keyboard_shortcuts.html" style="color: #66ccff; text-decoration: underline;">https://ace.c9.io/demo/keyboard_shortcuts.html</a>. Furthermore, to enhance user experience, one particular functionality that has been implemented in the <span style="color: #66ccff;">Editor</span> is that you can press <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #ff6666;">Ctrl (+)</span> to increase the font size and <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #ff6666;">Ctrl (-)</span> to decrease the font size.<br/><br/>
    
        It is also important to keep in mind that the working of these keyboard shortcuts as well as the target of your keyboard input (such as typing something) depends on which component of the IDE is in focus (i.e. the <span style="color: #66ccff;">Editor</span>, the <span style="color: #66ccff;">Emulator</span>, or neither). The one in focus will receive the keyboard input (and these shortcuts will not work if it is the <span style="color: #66ccff;">Emulator</span> that is in focus at the time). To shift focus to another component, simply click on that particular component (i.e. the <span style="color: #66ccff;">Editor</span>, the <span style="color: #66ccff;">Emulator</span>, or anywhere else). Furthermore, there is a problem that sometimes comes up due to certain issues with the loading of the <span style="color: #66ccff;">Emulator</span>: at times, upon clicking a button (or pressing a key), the <span style="color: #66ccff;">Emulator</span> loads but stays on drive <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #ffcc00;">Z</span> and does not mount <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #ffcc00;">C</span> or perform any action. In case this happens, please click that button (or key) again, and it should hopefully work as intended. Sorry for the inconvenience in this regard, but the issue is difficult to resolve without adding considerable complexity to the project. In any case, efforts have been made to reduce the frequency of the problem so that the user experience is not too adversely affected.<br/><br/>

        Anyways, that's all with regard to the usage instructions. Support for multiple files is in the works and will likely be made available in the next update, so stay tuned. Also, if you are interested in this project or have found it useful, please visit its GitHub repository at <a href="https://github.com/ASD0x41/xide/" style="color: #66ccff; text-decoration: underline;">https://github.com/ASD0x41/xide/</a> and <span style="font-weight: bold; color: green;">give it a star to show your support</span>. And if you are even more deeply interested, do check out the repository for the WASM port of DOSBox at <a href="https://github.com/dreamlayers/em-dosbox" style="color: #66ccff; text-decoration: underline;">https://github.com/dreamlayers/em-dosbox</a> as well, which is a very interesting project and forms the core of this one.<br/><br/>
